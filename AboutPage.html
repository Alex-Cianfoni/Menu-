    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Alex, Preston, and John were lifelong friends with a shared dream of opening a restaurant by the sea. After years of hard work, they turned an old building into the Krusty Crab—a cozy spot filled with charm, laughter, and the best seafood in town.

        Despite early challenges, their determination and teamwork brought the Krusty Crab to life. The community quickly fell in love with the delicious food and welcoming atmosphere. Locals and tourists alike came not just for the meals, but for the heart behind every dish.

        Today, the Krusty Crab is a thriving symbol of friendship and dreams coming true. It's more than a restaurant—it's a place where memories are made, stories are shared, and everyone feels at home.
